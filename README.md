# COVID19

This repo includes machine learning-based analysis for COVID19 data.

Update: March 31, 2020:
Two benchmarks for forecasting and image processing have been made so far. No rocket science yet!


1- Forecasting: 
- Data: We use data provided by the John Hopkins University:https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 
- Algorithms: So far, we applied a simple XGBoost for predicting the confirmed/recovered/deceased cases.
1- Image-processing:
- Data: We use this repo:https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset 
- Algorithms: So far, a tSNE analysis based on transfer learning visualized on the Tensorboard have been done.
